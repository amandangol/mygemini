MyGemini harnesses the cutting-edge capabilities of the Gemini 1.5 Pro model API, developed by Google. This advanced large language model powers all eight AI assistants within the app, enabling:

The Gemini 1.5 Pro model's extensive knowledge base and powerful reasoning capabilities allow MyGemini to provide intelligent assistance across a wide range of tasks, from casual conversations to complex problem-solving.

The app is built with Flutter and uses GetX for state management and navigation, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience across devices while leveraging the full potential of the Gemini 1.5 Pro API.
